More general (I guess)
M-x outline-minor-mode  collapses function definitions in a
file to a mere {...} 
M-x show-subtree  If you are in one of the collapsed functions,
this un-collapses it 

In order to achive some of the feats coming up now you have to run etags *.c
*.h *.cpp (or what ever ending you source files have) in the source
directory
M-.  (Thats Meta dot) If you are in a function call, this will
take you to it's definition 
M-x tags-search ENTER  Searches through all you etaged

M-x tags-query-replace  yum. This lets you replace some text in
all the tagged files
